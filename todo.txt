error testing is messy 

Organization of tokens is messy and arbitrary

Synonyms: 	REM	'
		PRINT	?
		BYE	QUIT, EXIT

REM should go to end of line OR to ':' 


Evaluation notes:
	Figure out how to mark evaluation lists for shunting

	Evaluate RPN (output from shunting)


RENUM issues:

	ON - check for adjusting line numbers.  this could get messy.

	continuations need line number adjustment as well.

	RENUM might have to work backwards.  this could get messy.

	Perhaps basic_line needs a flag of what this line number used
	to be, then do a second pass over the full list to adjust all of the numbers


goto out of FOR!
